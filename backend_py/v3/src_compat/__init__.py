"""
V3 Source Compatibility Layer
=============================

This module contains legacy src/ code inlined into v3 for compatibility.
These modules were migrated from backend_py/src/ when that package was deleted.

DEPRECATED: This compatibility layer will be removed when v3 is migrated to
            packs/roster/engine/ in PR-3.

Modules:
    - constraints: Hard constraint definitions (HARD_CONSTRAINTS dataclass)
    - models: Domain models (Tour, Block, Weekday)
    - assignment_constraints: Block assignment constraint checking
    - smart_block_builder: Tour → Block partitioning algorithm
    - block_heuristic_solver: Min-Cost Max-Flow block solver
    - forecast_solver_v4: Experimental V4 solver (R&D only)
