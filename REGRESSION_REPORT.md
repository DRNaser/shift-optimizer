# Golden Dataset Regression Report

**Generated**: 2026-01-07T14:43:32.411238+00:00

## Validation Mode

**Current Mode**: STATIC VALIDATION (solve_duration_ms=0)

This report was generated using static validation, which compares expected output
files against each other without executing the actual solver. This verifies:
- Dataset structure integrity
- Input/output file consistency
- KPI and audit field presence

For real solver regression testing, inject a solver instance via
`GoldenDatasetManager.validate_dataset(solver=your_solver)`. Real execution will
show `solve_duration_ms > 0` in the report.
